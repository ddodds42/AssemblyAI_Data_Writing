Transcribing Zoom recordings using the Zoom API and AssemblyAI in Python\n","\n","![Zoom_90s](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/zoom90s.gif)\n","\n","Wow, Zoom did itself a huge favor by rebranding since the 90's. This might actually be the main reason they survived the dotcom bubble.\n","\n","Shame on you if that wry joke is over your head.\n","\n","Zoom even has an API now folks! One of the many reasons to finally awaken from that 25 year coma! That's right, come back alive to the real simulation, and I'll show you how to use AssemblyAI to transcribe the words spoken in those Zoom meetings that have become such a ubiquitous aspect of our lives.\n","\n","![matrix](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/matrix.gif)\n","\n","\n","## Creating a Cloud Recording on Zoom\n","The first thing to know when creating a cloud recording in Zoom is that you must have a **Pro, Business, or Enterprise account**. The basic free Zoom plan does not have a meeting recording feature enabled. You may already have such a plan, and may already have cloud recordings ready for transcription, in which case, you can skip to the next header and keep rolling.\n","\n","But if you've just gotten an upgraded Zoom account for your project, and you still need to create a cloud recording, a few things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- You do not need to have another person on the meeting for cloud recording to work. No need to schedule with someone else, just let it rip on your device and start the recording.\n","\n","- The button looks like this if you're on a desktop, laptop, or large tablet:\n","![desktop_button](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/desktop_recording_button.jpg)\n","\n","- If you're on a phone or small tablet, the cloud recording button hides down yonder behind those 3 dots.\n","![phone_button](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/phone_button.jpg)\n","\n","- If you would like to test cloud recording and transcription with multiple people on the line, and you happen to be doing this with a friend's device that's in the same room, a couple of acoustic notes. You'll want to make sure that only one device at a time as unmuted and producing sound, or the feedback will scratch out your eardrums.\n","\n","- Another strange thing I noticed while cloud recording with multiple devices is that only the non-host's device will feed sound to the recording while you're muting one to prevent feedback. For some reason, if the host's device is unmuted while you're speaking, that sound will not be captured by Zoom's cloud recording.\n","\n","- You might as well dodge both of those recording dilemmas by having each person and each device in separate rooms. That way the sound barriers prevent the feedback, and both parties can unmute.\n","\n","Whew, now that those details are out of the way, end that meeting, and let's go find that cloud recording!\n","\n","Upon ending the recording, a pop-up box will tell you that you'll get an email once the recording is ready. Zoom's help pages cautiously warn users that it could take 24-48 hours for it to be ready, but that was likely the reality in early 2020 when the whole world flocked onto Zoom before their systems were ready for that level of traffic. It may still take a while for longer recordings, but I've found that here in 2021, for the short test recordings I've been transcribing, they are ready just about immediately.\n","\n","Wow it feels great to talk trash about 2020 like it's a long-gone ex.\n","\n","Anyway, to find your recording, sign into Zoom, and navigate to **My Account**.\n","![my_account](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/mtg_my_account.JPG)\n","\n","To the left, to the left, everything you want in a link to the left. Click on that **\"Recordings\"** tab over yonder on the left side.\n","![recordings](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/mtg_recordings.JPG)\n","\n","And now, the promised land! There you will see your cloud recordings, ready for you in mp4 and m4a format.\n","![recording_list](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/mtg_recording_list.JPG)\n","\n","\n","## Accessing Zoom's API Key\n","Now, let's step through the process of getting keys to Zoom's backdoor. I'd like to give a shoutout to Billy Harmawan for [showing me this somewhat convoluted process](https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-automate-my-church-organisations-zoom-meeting-attendance-reporting-with-python-419dfe7da58c). I'll give you the gist of it here too.\n","\n","First, you will need to navigate to [Zoom's App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) in a new tab. You may have already been signed in from your main account page, but if not, you can sign in using the same credentials, and then navigate back to the Zoom App Marketplace once logged in.\n","\n","Second, click **\"Develop\"** in the upper right corner, and **\"Build App\"** from the drop-down menu.\n","![build_app](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/1_app_mkt_build_app.JPG)\n","\n","Third, you will need to choose **\"Create\"** under the **\"JWT\"** app type. We will be using JSON Web Tokens (JWT's) for this transcription connection because of their ease of regeneration, use in code, and appendability to url's.\n","![app_type](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/2_app_type_jwt.JPG)\n","\n","Fourth, come up with a unique name for your Zoom app.\n","\n","![app_name](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/3_app_name.JPG)\n","\n","Fifth, you will need to fill out the required fields on the information page that it takes you to.\n","![app_info](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/4_app_info.JPG)\n","\n","Sixth, on the following page, your API credentials should be generated!\n","![app_tokens](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/5_zoom_tokens.JPG)\n","\n","From here, **create a \"tokens.env\"** text file, and save each credential under a variable name. You will need this .env file in the code later.\n","\n","![dotenv](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/5_5_dotenv.jpg)\n","\n","A note: that _first_ JWT token that is generated on the credentials page is nice to have in the dotenv file just in case, but our code will be generating new JWT's that will be used instead. So have it copied, but just know that it might not be necessary.\n","\n","And lastly, you can skip the optional \"Feature\" tab on this app creation page and go directly to **\"Activation\"** to confirm that you are finished.\n","![active](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/6_app_active.JPG)\n","\n","These next few steps are just double and triple checks to make sure that the app exists in your account and that the credentials can be managed in the future if you need to.\n","\n","Navigate back to [Zoom's App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) and click the **\"Manage\"** button in the upper right corner.\n","![find_app](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/7_find_app.JPG)\n","\n","There you will see your app listed.\n","![dashboard](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/8_app_dashboard.JPG)\n","\n","**Click on the name of the app**, and when you see this screen once again...\n","![manage](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/9_manage_app.JPG)\n","\n","...you can rest assured knowing deep in your bones that the Zoom's API is ready for you.\n","\n","## Sign up for an AssemblyAI API Token\n","But are _YOU_ ready with your AssemblyAI API Token?? If not, totally chill, I got you. Here's how to get yours.\n","\n","You can sign up for a [free AssemblyAI account](https://app.assemblyai.com/login/) in seconds by just entering your email address. After you verify your account from your email address, you're taken right back to your new account where you can see your API token in your dashboard.\n","![AssemblyAI_key](https://github.com/ddodds42/AssemblyAI_Data_Writing/raw/master/Zoom_API_Post/screencaps/Assembly_AI_API_Key.png)\n","\n","Take that API Token and add it to your dotenv file in the same way you did for Zoom's API Keys, with it's own unique variable name.\n","\n","## Fetching a Cloud Recording from Zoom's API in Python\n","It is time AT LAST to flex on these codes and do our digital Indiana Jones thang.\n","\n","Plop these fresh import statements into your notebook:\n","\n","```\n","import sys\n","import time\n","import requests\n","import authlib\n","import os\n","import urllib.request\n","from dotenv import load_dotenv\n","from pathlib import Path\n","from typing import Optional, Dict, Union, Any\n","from authlib.jose import jwt\n","from requests import Response\n","import http.client\n","import json\n","```\n","\n","Now find your directory path to your icy dotenv file, or move the dotenv file to your notebook directory, and plop that path into this code block where it belongs:\n","```\n","env_path = Path('.')/'tokens.env'\n","load_dotenv(dotenv_path=env_path)\n","```\n","\n","Next, you'll scoop those white-hot credentials out of the dotenv file by naming them to some notebooke variables.
